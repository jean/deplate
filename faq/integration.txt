* How to use ''deplate'' as text filter for other (web-based) applications?
#OPT: id=Integration

CAVEAT deplate wasn't designed as a converter for personal use and not 
as a formatting engine for a publicly accessible wiki or CMS.
    - It is most likely unsafe to allow public access over the Internet 
      to a deplate-based wiki. Malicious users could possibly execute 
      ruby code, access your file system, or simply crash the converter 
      (which could be an annoyance in some situations).
    - Malformed input can make deplate behave disgracefully.
      
Use it at your own risk!

All of the following is highly experimental and has never been thorougly 
tested.  Think of the material on this page as proof of concept!

Here is a [[instiki-0.11.0.diff][patch for Instiki 0.11.0]] that enables 
you to use deplate (CVS 12 April 2006) as formatting engine. You will 
have to edit ''lib/deplatesupport.rb'' and set the ''DEPLATE'' and 
''IMGBASEURL'' constants.

This patch is really just something to start and to experiment with. 
Don't expect it work properly/safely just like that.

Neither pdf generation nor latex/docbook output are supported at the 
moment -- you could export the raw markup though and then process it 
offline.

** Via \TextPipe (a perl module)
#OPT: id=TextPipe
#textpipe

Andrea Rota wrote a generic perl module that can be used to convert text 
from some markup to html using external text filters like ''deplate''.

#Quote <<----------------------
This module helps with the setup of text filters: given a text
processing tool (such as rest2html, rest2latex, deplate, etc.)
\TextPipe reads an input string, lets the text processing tool
process text and returns marked-up output to calling application.

This module was written mainly to allow non-Perl text processing
tools to be used in Perl applications.
----------------------

Be {text style=bold: warned} though that
    - this is {text style=bold: untested code} (the authors themselves 
      abandonded ''deplate'' :-( in favor of 
      [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net][reStructuredText]])
    - the performance is quite __poor__ due to the use of temporary files
    - the code does not have accompanying tests (i.e., it hasn't been 
      stress-tested or debugged in any way)
    - the code is provided as-is; if you run into difficulties, you're 
      on your own

If you find it useful, feel free to write the missing bits.

** Via XMLRPC
#OPT: id=XMLRPC
#xmlrpc

The idea is to let deplate run in a secured environment and to access it 
via its xmlrpc interface. This way you could use deplate also from a php 
or java-based appication.
