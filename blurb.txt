deplate is a [[http://www.ruby-lang.org][ruby]]-based tool that converts 
wiki-like markup to LaTeX, HTML, \DocBook, or really plain text. It 
currently supports the following input formats:

    - "native" viki/deplate markup with variations: full, restricted, 
      template, play, headings (~~outline)
    - ruby's [[http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/][rdoc]]

It currently supports the following output formats:

    - HTML: single page, chunked (small website, HTML-based slideshow)
    - PHP = HTML + extras
    - LaTeX: standard document classes, koma, dramatist
    - \DocBook: article, book, man/ref
    - Really plain text

The "native" viki/deplate markup supports page templates, embedded LaTeX 
code, footnotes, citations, bibliographies, semi-automatic index 
generation, table of contents etc.
It is suitable for writing articles, books, plays (for screen or stage), 
or for creating small websites. By means of LaTeX or \DocBook, it is 
possible to create PDF or RTF documents.
From a user perspective, viki/deplate is an intermediary format that can 
replace LaTeX. deplate's LaTeX output is intended to be readable and 
well formatted. Because of the tight integration with LaTeX, you still 
get most of its features but with fewer quirks and support for more 
output formats. At least, that's the idea. :-)

''deplate'' __aims__ to be modular and easily extensible. It is the 
accompanying converter for the
[[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=861][Vim viki plugin]].
% For the records: In the family of wiki markups/engines, the viki/deplate 
% markup originated from 
% [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsWikiMode][emacs-wiki]]. 
% Although the default markup has changed since its first release, it 
% still includes a module that is supposed to convert emacs-wiki markup as 
% of 2003.

A note on code quality: This is a personal pet project and the result of 
a series of early morning pre-coffee plumbing. It originally served two 
purposes: learn ruby, convert 
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsWikiMode][emacs-wiki]] 
pages without emacs. It has improved since then but not always in the 
most advantageous manner. It works for me though and has proven quite 
useful.
